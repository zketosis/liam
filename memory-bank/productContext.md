# Product Context

## Purpose
Liam Migration aims to address the challenges associated with complex DB schema changes by providing AI-assisted solutions that reduce risks and rework costs. It is designed to enable development teams to manage release cycles safely and efficiently.

## Problems Solved
- **Dilemma of Fast Development and Quality Assurance**: Frequent specification changes and accelerated implementation speed due to AI code generation lead to design deficiencies and technical debt, making it difficult to balance quality and development speed.
- **Irreversibility Risk of DB Schema Changes**: Column deletions and type changes are difficult to roll back, increasing the fear of changes and causing overly cautious development cycles.
- **Lack of Review Due to Personalization**: Limited members with DB design knowledge lead to a lack of review systems, causing development stagnation and difficulty in unifying design guidelines across teams.

## How It Works
Liam Migration provides a comprehensive solution that includes:
- **Review Agent**: An AI component that automatically analyzes migration impact, visualizes risks, and predicts performance and data integrity impacts.
- **Interactive Knowledge Base**: Promotes contextual understanding by linking review comments with ER diagrams and automatically extracts and formalizes team-specific best practices.
- **Continuous Quality Optimization**: Establishes quality standards through the reuse of review comments and provides phased optimization according to project scale and maturity.

## User Experience Goals
- Provide a seamless and efficient review process for Reviewer Users, focusing on safety and speed in scaling DB schemas.
- Ensure that Builder User features are developed in later phases, leveraging accumulated review data and feedback for future optimization.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for reviewing migration changes, cautions, and AI suggestions, allowing users to understand review status and improvement points effectively.
