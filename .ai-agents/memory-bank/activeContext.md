3. **Deployment Process**:

   - Use trigger.dev CLI for deploying background jobs
   - Run `npx trigger.dev deploy --dry-run` to verify deployment without applying changes
   - Run `npx trigger.dev deploy` to deploy to production
   - CI/CD pipelines use `pnpm deploy:jobs` command defined in the root package.json

4. **Component Implementation**:

   - Use named exports instead of default exports
   - Prioritize CSS Variables from @liam-hq/ui
   - Prefer UI components from @liam-hq/ui
   - Import icons from @liam-hq/ui
   - When implementing designs from Figma using the Figma MCP tool, always reference 'frontend/packages/ui/src/styles/Dark/variables.css' for colors, padding, gap, spacing, and borderRadius values
   - When specifying colors, prioritize semantic color definitions (e.g., --primary-accent, --global-foreground) and avoid using --color- prefixed variables whenever possible

5. **Database Access**:

   - Use type assertions for Supabase types
   - Handle bigint to number conversions
   - Properly type nested relationship data
   - Use optimized queries with nested joins
   - Cache query results when they'll be reused
   - Follow migration guidelines in `docs/migrationOpsContext.md` when creating database migrations
   - Adhere to schema design patterns in `docs/schemaPatterns.md` for consistent database design

6. **Function Organization**:
   - Separate business logic into dedicated function files
   - Call functions from task definitions
   - Chain tasks to form complete workflows
   - Extract reusable logic into helper functions
