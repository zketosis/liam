Liam ERD Web is an online tool hosted by [@liam-hq](https://github.com/liam-hq) that allows you to explore real-world ER diagrams without needing to install a CLI! 🛸💫

It enables you to view ER diagrams generated from publicly available schema files, such as `db/schema.rb`, `prisma.schema`, or SQL files derived from `pg_dump`.

## How to Explore

Inserting `liambx.com/erd/p/` into your browser's address bar will generate an ER diagram for your schema file.

For example, if the schema file you want to explore is hosted at the following URL:

```
# A public repo's schema file
https://github.com/docusealco/docuseal/blob/master/db/schema.rb
```

You can generate an ER diagram by inserting `liambx.com/erd/p/` into the URL:

```
https://liambx.com/erd/p/github.com/docusealco/docuseal/blob/master/db/schema.rb
      👾^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^👾
```

It's so easy! Isn't it? 🚀

## Tips & Tricks

### Bookmarklet for Quick Access

You can create a bookmarklet to quickly open schema files in Liam ERD. Here's how:

1. Create a new bookmark in your browser
2. Set the following JavaScript code as the URL:

```javascript
javascript:(function(){var u=window.location.href;var newUrl="https://liambx.com/erd/p/" + u.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '');window.open(newUrl,'_blank');})();
```

Now, when viewing a schema file (like `schema.rb`) on GitHub, simply click the bookmarklet to open it directly in Liam ERD! 🎯

## Appendix: Schema Format Options

### Schema Format

Liam ERD automatically detects the schema format. If needed, you can override the detected format using the `format` query parameter:

```
https://liambx.com/erd/p/public.example.net/path/to/file?format=schemarb
```
