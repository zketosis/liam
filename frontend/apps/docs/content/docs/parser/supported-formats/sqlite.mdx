title: SQLite

Currently, SQLite is supported through the tbls integration. While direct SQLite support is not yet implemented, you can use tbls as a workaround to generate schema documentation for your SQLite database.

## Using tbls with SQLite

1. First, install tbls by following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls?tab=readme-ov-file#install)

2. Use tbls to generate a schema.json file from your SQLite database:

```bash
tbls out -t json -o schema.json "sqlite:///path/to/dbname.db"
```

Replace `/path/to/dbname.db` with the path to your SQLite database file.

3. Use the generated schema.json with Liam:

```bash
npx @liam-hq/cli erd build --format=tbls --input schema.json
```

For more details about using tbls format, see the [tbls documentation](/docs/parser/supported-formats/tbls#using-tbls-json-output).

## Direct SQLite Support

Direct SQLite support is planned but not yet implemented. If you're interested in this feature, please follow or contribute to the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/discussions/364).
