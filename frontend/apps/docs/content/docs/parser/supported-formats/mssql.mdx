title: Microsoft SQL Server
---

Currently, Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) is supported through the tbls integration. While direct MSSQL support is not yet implemented, you can use tbls as a workaround to generate schema documentation for your MSSQL database.

## Using tbls with Microsoft SQL Server

1. First, install tbls by following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls?tab=readme-ov-file#install)

2. Use tbls to generate a schema.json file from your MSSQL database:

```bash
tbls out -t json -o schema.json "mssql://dbuser:dbpass@hostname:1433/dbname"
```

Replace the following with your database details:

- `dbuser`: Your MSSQL username
- `dbpass`: Your MSSQL password
- `hostname`: Your database host (e.g., localhost)
- `1433`: Port number (default is 1433)
- `dbname`: Your database name

3. Use the generated schema.json with Liam:

```bash
npx @liam-hq/cli erd build --format=tbls --input schema.json
```

You can find sample implementations for this case on GitHub:

- GitHub Actions: [.github/workflows/mssql-with-tbls.yml](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam-erd-samples/blob/main/.github/workflows/mssql-with-tbls.yml)
- tbls project: [samples/mssql-with-tbls](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam-erd-samples/tree/main/samples/mssql-with-tbls)

For more details about using tbls format, see the [tbls documentation](/docs/parser/supported-formats/tbls#using-tbls-json-output).

## Direct MSSQL Support

Direct MSSQL support is planned but not yet implemented. If you're interested in this feature, please follow or contribute to the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/discussions/364).
