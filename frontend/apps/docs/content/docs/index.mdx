## How to Get Started

### Public Project Setup

Want a quick setup for a public repository?
For example, if the schema file you want to explore is hosted at the following URL:

```
# A public repo's schema file
https://github.com/docusealco/docuseal/blob/master/db/schema.rb
```

You can generate an ER diagram by inserting `liambx.com/erd/p/` into the URL:

```
https://liambx.com/erd/p/github.com/docusealco/docuseal/blob/master/db/schema.rb
      👾^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^👾
```

For detailed instructions, check out [Web version](/docs/web).

### Private Project Setup

For internal or private repositories, run this command to start an interactive setup:

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="npm" copyable>npx @liam-hq/cli init</Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm" copyable>pnpm dlx @liam-hq/cli init</Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn" copyable>yarn dlx @liam-hq/cli init</Tab>
  <Tab value="bun" copyable>bun x @liam-hq/cli init</Tab>
</Tabs>

Then follow the prompts to build a static version of your diagrams.
