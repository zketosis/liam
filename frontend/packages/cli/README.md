# @liam/cli

Command-line tool designed to generate a web application that displays ER diagrams.

```bash
$ liam erd build --input {your .sql}
# Outputs the web application to the ./public and ./dist directories

$ liam erd preview

```

## Test

## Building and Installing the Standalone CLI for Development

To build the CLI for development purposes, run:

```bash
pnpm run build
# The executable will be output to dist-cli/bin/cli.js.
```

After building, you can invoke it locally with:

```bash
node ./dist-cli/bin/cli.js erd build --input ./fixtures/input.schema.rb
```

To make it globally accessible as `liam`, use:

```bash
pnpm link --global
```
