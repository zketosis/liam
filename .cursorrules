### Required file reads on startup

### Coding Environment

The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- TypeScript
- NodeJS
- HTML
- CSS Modules
- pnpm

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use TypeScript for all components and functions.
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use CSS Modules for styling HTML elements.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like "handleClick" for onClick and "handleKeyDown" for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex="0", aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, "const toggle = () =>". Also, define a type if possible.

### Documentation Guidelines

Follow these rules when creating user documentation:

- Add new documentation files in MDX format under `/frontend/apps/docs/content`
- Write all documentation content in English
- Maintain consistency with existing documentation pages:
  - Use similar tone and writing style
  - Follow the same formatting conventions
  - Match heading structure and hierarchy
  - Use consistent terminology throughout
